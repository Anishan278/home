                <h1> Issues of Cat Abuse</h1>
        </div>
		<div class = "abuse">
		<p>Animal abuse is a very serious issue as it is a very inhuman <br>
		thing to do considering they are supposed to be our companions. <br>
		It happens very often throughout the world, some which are less <br>
		severe while others are far worse and more painful and inflicted <br>
		upon the animal. Cats are amongst one of the most abused animals as <br>
		it is very common to have them as a housepet and they are very <br>
		accessible to people. <br> </p>
		</div>
		<br><br>
		<div class = "abuse2">
		<p>Abuse can come in many forms, some might be beating or <br>
		hitting the animals, while others can be straight up not <br>
		feeding and leaving it malnourished for days, weeks or even <br>
		months. Being kept in horrible conditions can also be abuse <br>
		inflicted upon the animal as it is very unhealthy for them. <br>
		 <br></p>

		<p class = "abuse4">In this video a woman by the name of Michelline Joy Toulouse was <br>
		arrested for 9 counts of animal cruelty after the police found fifty <br>
		cats that were malnourished and in filthy conditions at her apartment. <br>
		When these cats were found around ten of them were already dead and the <br>
		rest were in critical condition. There are many different cases of this <br>
		kind, however the scary part is that this woman had a job of being an <br>
		animal rescuer. So if the police barely found this person out,  how <br>
		many more of these situations are continuously happening that are <br>
		unknowing to the public? <br>

			<li>Encourage people to love animals</li>
			<li>Try to adopt and foster these animals</li>
			<li>Safely report to the authorities if you witness any animal cruelty</li>
