		<h3 class = "homepage"> Domestic cats are very majestic animals that are housepets to many people. They can be described as <br>
		carnivorous (meat eaters) with very sharp teeth and long claws. They have been domesticated around 10 000 <br>
		years ago and even throughout all of these years they still prove to be relevant and helpful in society. <br>
		They provide companionship, comfort or even amusement to people who own them. Thereâ€™s also many different <br>
		breeds of cats defined by characteristics which make them unique. <br><br><br><br><br><br> </h3>
